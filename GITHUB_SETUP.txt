FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO DEPLOY:

1. CREATE GITHUB ACCOUNT (if you don't have one):
   - Go to github.com
   - Click "Sign up"
   - Use your email

2. CREATE NEW REPOSITORY:
   - After signing in, click "+"
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name it: webbb
   - Click "Create repository"
   - DO NOT initialize with README (we already have code)

3. COPY THE COMMANDS FROM GITHUB:
   - You'll see setup instructions
   - Copy the HTTPS URL shown (like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webbb.git)

4. IN THIS TERMINAL, RUN:
   cd /Users/braydenrees/Desktop/webbb
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webbb.git
   git push -u origin main

   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)

5. ENTER YOUR CREDENTIALS:
   - GitHub will ask for username/password
   - Use your GitHub username
   - For password, use a Personal Access Token (not your password):
     * Go to github.com/settings/tokens
     * Click "Generate new token"
     * Select "repo" scope
     * Copy the token and paste it as password

DONE! Your code is now on GitHub.

NEXT: Go to render.com and deploy from there.
